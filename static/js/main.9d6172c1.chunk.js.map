For instance, the effects of redlining are still highly visible in residential segregation as well as gentrification patterns occurring frequently in areas rated poorly in the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps.

With the recent emergence of Silicon Valley, the Bay Area now generates massive amounts of wealth, with an estimated GDP of $275 billion (Pulkkinen). However, rather than using this influx of resources to redress these injustices, it is instead perpetrating further injustices: locally, by displacing longtime residents of color through rising costs of living, increasing disparities in wealth and basic services, as well as contributing to further erasure of narratives of marginalized peoples; nationally, enabling mass deportations; and globally, by extracting rare earth metals through exploitation of vulnerable populations. Furthermore, the extent of the involvement of the U.S. government in perpetrating both historical and present forms of injustices is often erased or minimized. In reality, federal government has been directly responsible for creating the systems and structures that enabled and institutionalized injustices, as well as actively sanctioning and sponsoring efforts to harm minoritized communities.</p>\n      </div>\n    </Section>,\n    <SplitSection id=\"housing\">\n      <div className=\"left\">\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"right\">\n        <div className=\"text-container\">\n          <p>Now, tech companies have taken on the mantle of continuing the legacy of environmental injustices against people of color and low-income residents. With every passing moment, people in the Bay Area are being displaced and dispossessed from the places they have lived for most of their lives, places where they have developed a sense of identity and formed relationships to. Often, priced out of the places they have lived historically, these people are relegated to the most polluted areas and pushed further towards the edges of the Bay, increasing their commutes to unreasonable lengths.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </SplitSection>,\n    <SplitSection id=\"extraction\">\n      <div className=\"left\">\n        <div className=\"text-container\">\n          <p>Despite many of the large tech companies’ commitment to sustainability, they still largely rely on the extractive and exploitative global systems that are responsible for producing many of the largest issues we face today, in which they exploit vulnerable populations for labor and extract natural resources from the earth at unsustainable rates. The mining of cobalt, a rare earth metal, is a clear example of the ways in which tech companies are directly responsible and culpable in perpetuating exploitative and extractive practices. Cobalt is a key component within the lithium-ion batteries commonly used in smartphones and other electronic devices, yet the miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo earn about nine dollars or less every day while working 12-hour shifts (Walt & Meyer).</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"right\">\n      </div>\n    </SplitSection>,\n    <Section id=\"ice\">\n      <div className=\"text-container\">\n        <p>Given the massive platforms that technology enables and their incredible power to shape the way people take in information and perceive the world, tech and media companies are no longer simply complicit in continuing legacies of erasing narratives of BIPOC, but active perpetrators of marginalization, displacement, and violence. Through the seemingly objective lens provided by data, they are further entrenching systems of marginalization and oppression that will be harder to criticize than ever. It also functions in ways that are largely invisible to populations not directly affected. For instance, Amazon and Palantir provide much of the technical infrastructure that has enabled ICE to perform deportations on a larger scale and with greater ease (Glaser, Hao). While issues such as these are still working their ways into public consciousness, community organizations such as Mijente are attempting to increase visibility for these issues and the role of tech companies in causing them and uplift the voices of affected communities, who are primarily Latinx immigrants.</p>\n      </div>\n    </Section>\n  ]);\n}\n\nexport default Present;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Section from '../components/Section';\nimport SplitSection from '../components/SplitSection';\n\nfunction Futures() {\n  return ([\n    <Section id=\"futures\" name=\"Envisioning Just Futures for Technology\">\n      <div className=\"text-container\">\n        <p>However, technology does not necessarily have to be used to perpetuate injustices; in fact, there already exist efforts to resist oppressive systems and expose the consequences associated with the rise of Silicon Valley, as well as to center the narratives of historically marginalized populations.
