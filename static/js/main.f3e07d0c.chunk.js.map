However, the violence did not end there, as in the mid-19th century, as the Gold Rush was occurring, California spent about $1.5 million on state-sponsored campaigns to massacre Native Americans, with the financial backing of the federal government (Nazaryan, 2016).</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"right\">\n        <div className=\"text-container\">\n          <p>This is a snippet of the Future Ecologies podcast, in which Corrina Gould, a spokesperson for the Confederated Villages of Lisjan/Ohlone, tells the story about how Tuyshtak, meaning \"The Holy Place,\" was renamed Mt.

Under Leland Stanford, who considered Chinese people to be “an inferior race,” thousands of Chinese workers were employed to build the railroads, including the Transcontinental Railroad, working longer hours for lower wages and taking on more dangerous parts of the construction (Zraick & Lee, 2019).</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </SplitSection>,\n    <Section id=\"redlining\">\n      <div className=\"text-container\">\n        <p>These forms of violence did not cease within the next century, as the U.S. government seized the land and property of as well as forcibly displaced and imprisoned Japanese-Americans within concentration camps during World War II (Frail, 2017).

For instance, the effects of redlining are still highly visible in residential segregation as well as gentrification patterns occurring frequently in areas rated poorly in the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps.

With the recent emergence of Silicon Valley, the Bay Area now generates massive amounts of wealth, with an estimated GDP of $275 billion (Pulkkinen, 2019). However, rather than using this influx of resources to redress these injustices, it is instead perpetrating further injustices: locally, by displacing longtime residents of color through rising costs of living, increasing disparities in wealth and basic services, as well as contributing to further erasure of narratives of marginalized peoples; nationally, enabling mass deportations; and globally, by extracting rare earth metals through exploitation of vulnerable populations. Furthermore, the extent of the involvement of the U.S. government in perpetrating both historical and present forms of injustices is often erased or minimized. In reality, federal government has been directly responsible for creating the systems and structures that enabled and institutionalized injustices, as well as actively sanctioning and sponsoring efforts to harm minoritized communities. </p>\n      </div>\n    </Section>,\n    <SplitSection id=\"housing\">\n      <div className=\"left\">\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"right\">\n        <div className=\"text-container\">\n          <p>Now, tech companies have taken on the mantle of continuing the legacy of environmental injustices against people of color and low-income residents. With every passing moment, people in the Bay Area are being displaced and dispossessed from the places they have lived for most of their lives, places where they have developed a sense of identity and formed relationships to. Often, priced out of the places they have lived historically, these people are relegated to the most polluted areas and pushed further towards the edges of the Bay, increasing their commutes to unreasonable lengths.</p>\n          <p>This image to the left is of people protesting Lennar Corporation’s development of the Bayview-Hunters Point area. After historic radioactive pollution of the low-income communities of color that live in Bayview-Hunters Point from the decommissioned shipyard nearby as well as a cover-up of a cleanup that never took place, Lennar is building luxury housing in the area just as the cleanup is supposed to finally occur (Greenaction). This means that the residents, who have not only been exposed to harmful pollutants but have also formed relationships to the community and the places in Bayview-Hunters Point, would be displaced, receiving none of the benefits of development while bearing the full burden of the cost, yet another manifestation of the larger pattern of settler colonialism that has repeatedly occurred throughout history.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </SplitSection>,\n    <SplitSection id=\"extraction\">\n      <div className=\"left\">\n        <div className=\"text-container\">\n          <p>Despite many of the large tech companies’ commitment to sustainability, they still largely rely on the extractive and exploitative global systems that are responsible for producing many of the largest issues we face today, in which they exploit vulnerable populations for labor and extract natural resources from the earth, practices that are inherently unjust and unsustainable. The mining of cobalt, a rare earth metal, is a clear example of the ways in which tech companies are directly responsible and culpable in perpetuating exploitative and extractive practices. Cobalt is a key component within the lithium-ion batteries commonly used in smartphones and other electronic devices, yet the miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo earn about nine dollars or less every day while working 12-hour shifts (Walt & Meyer, 2019).</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"right\">\n      </div>\n    </SplitSection>,\n    <Section id=\"ice\">\n      <div className=\"text-container\">\n        <p><span className=\"red-text\">“The tech products created in Silicon Valley and distributed globally are not racially neutral but rather carry the imprint of the dominant culture in which they are created, exporting those assumptions and ideas to other cultures”</span> (Daniels, J., Nkonde, M., & Mir, D., 2019).</p>\n        <p>Given the massive platforms that technology enables and their incredible power to shape the way people take in information and perceive the world, tech and media companies are no longer simply complicit in continuing legacies of erasing narratives of BIPOC, but active perpetrators of marginalization, displacement, and violence. Through the seemingly objective lens provided by data, they are further entrenching systems of marginalization and oppression that will be harder to criticize than ever. Tech also functions in ways that are largely invisible to populations not directly affected. For instance, Amazon and Palantir provide much of the technical infrastructure that has enabled ICE to perform deportations on a larger scale and with greater ease (Glaser, 2019; Hao, 2019). While issues such as these are still working their ways into public consciousness, community organizations such as Mijente are attempting to increase visibility for these issues and the role of tech companies in causing them and uplift the voices of affected communities, who are primarily Latinx immigrants.</p>\n      </div>\n    </Section>\n  ]);\n}\n\nexport default Present;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Section from '../components/Section';\nimport SplitSection from '../components/SplitSection';\n\nfunction Futures() {\n  return ([\n    <Section id=\"futures\" name=\"Envisioning Just Futures for Technology\">\n      <div className=\"text-container\">\n        <p>However, technology does not necessarily have to be used to perpetuate injustices; in fact, there already exist efforts in tech to resist oppressive systems and expose the consequences associated with the rise of Silicon Valley, as well as to center the narratives of historically marginalized populations.
