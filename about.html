        <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="bio" id="bio1">
        <p>Currently, Chris is a senior at Pinole Valley High School, where he will be graduating from this June. He has a variety of interests in different areas, extending from playing sports like basketball and tennis to contemplating current issues within politics. However, his primary passions lie in the environment, social justice, and computer science. When heâ€™s not doing academic work, you can often find him planting trees in the community, reading articles on The Atlantic, playing sports, or learning about anything that piques his curiosity on the Internet.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bio" id="bio2">
        <p>Starting this fall, he will be studying computer science at Stanford University, in hopes of eventually becoming able to use his skills to make a positive impact on the world. Along with nine other rising Stanford freshmen, he is co-founding a non-profit organization called Project AmaRNA, which aspires to educate and empower patients with chronic or terminal illnesses as well as their families, and to provide them with the information and support to make living with those illnesses easier.</p>

      <div class="bio" id="bio3">
        <p>Additionally, he hopes to promote awareness about the environment and to encourage people to take extensive action to protect it and allow it to flourish. To this end, he is aiming to eventually go zero-waste and make living sustainably more practical and convenient while exploring long-term solutions to current harmful practices. He loves being in nature, especially going on hikes through nature and planting trees in urban spaces, which he does nearly every week. He envisions a completely sustainable future in which technology and nature are able to coexist in harmony.</p>

      <div class="bio" id="bio4">
        <p>As a student and resident of West Contra Costa, where many are facing economic hardships, he has witnessed firsthand the effects a dearth of socioeconomic capital can have on a community, such as less funding for schools, worse environmental conditions, and exploitation by large corporations. Consequently, he has become a strong proponent of social justice to help low-income and other disadvantaged communities.</p>
