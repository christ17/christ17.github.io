      <p>I'm Chris, I use they/any pronouns, and I'm a recent graduate ('22) from Stanford majoring in Computer Science, with minors in Comparative Studies in Race & Ethnicity (CSRE) and Earth Systems.</p>
      <p>I'm interested in the intersection of justice and technology, and lots of my work centers around environmental and racial justice. I'm excited to continue learning and healing as I strive to envision and materialize just futures.</p>
      <p>When I'm not working, you can find me playing basketball, listening to music, and just spending time with people! I've also recently been getting into digital photography, playlist curation, dance, and poetry.</p>

        <p>In <i>CS 147: Intro to Human-Computer Interaction</i>, my team and I built <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs147/2022/wi/projects/SystemicJusticeAndEquity/sprout/" target="_blank">sprout</a>, a project that aims to create a source of community and resources for people who want to get involved in activism. Together, we went through user-centered design and prototyping processes, and built a working prototype in React Native.</p>
        <p>Some of my key responsibilities on the team included UI/UX design for the app using Figma, styling the React Native app, design and maintenance of the website, and slide deck concept design and templating.</p>

        <p>This past summer, I helped launch <a href="https://www.collectiveknow.org" target="_blank">Collective Knowledge</a>, a program that aims to cultivate BI&POC leadership and sustain our movements through mentorship and intergenerational knowledge sharing.</p>
        <p>I was part of the advisory board and the design subteam, helping to craft the language and visuals of the program. In these roles, I created the application forms in Airtable, created the style guide, built the website, and wrote up documentation.</p>

        <h3>Abolish Stanford</h3>
        <p>For my senior project, I worked with Mina Mahmood to make a website for <a href="https://abolishstanford.github.io" target="_blank">Abolish Stanford</a>, an autonomous formation fighting for police abolition and total liberation at Stanford University and across the San Francisco Peninsula.</p>
        <p>Our project is built using Gatsby, and we used web scraping along with natural language processing to create a newsfeed with articles relating to abolition.</p>

        <p><a href="https://issuu.com/nikinn/docs/deconstruct__recreate" target="_blank"><i>deconstruct, recreate</i></a> is a zine that I made in collaboration with some of my classmates for <i>ASNAMST 100: Intro to Asian American Studies</i> as a response to the question "What is Asian American Studies, and why do we need it now?"</p>
        <p>Jasmine Nguyen and I were responsible for the design and formatting of the zine. In addition, I contributed the following sections and poems: <i>land disclaimer; introduction; we were just fine; honor ancestors, unearth histories; scarcity;</i> and <i>forest / fog / fire</i>.</p>

        <h3>Generation Rising & Seed the Vote</h3>
        <p>In the summer of 2020, I interned with <a href="https://generationrisingup.org" target="_blank">Generation Rising</a> and <a href="https://www.seedthevote.org" target="_blank">Seed the Vote</a>, non-profit organizations that focus on building political power for people of color for the rights and well-being of all peoples. I re-designed both of the websites in Figma, then developed custom WordPress themes for each of them using PHP, HTML, Sass, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Through my internship with Generation Rising, I was also able to participate in political education sessions on topics such as abolition and transformative justice, and build community alongside other youth of color.</p>

        <h3>Sogorea Te' Land Trust</h3>
        <p>For <i>CSRE 125E: Shades of Green</i>, a project-based class focused on environmental justice, my group's community partner was the <a href="https://sogoreate-landtrust.org" target="_blank">Sogorea Te' Land Trust</a>, an urban Indigenous women-led land trust that rematriates traditional Ohlone lands in what is now known as the East Bay.</p>
        <p>My group and I decided to make a <a href="media/work/resourceguide.pdf" target="_blank">resource guide</a> about the Shuumi Land Tax to explore the topic of land reparations to Indigenous peoples and its importance. In addition, we created social media graphics to raise awareness and engage new audiences.</p>

        <p><a href="https://stanfordrewired.com" target="_blank">Rewired</a> is a digital publication that aims to shift how Stanford thinks about technology. I was part of the founding team for Rewired, and helped shape the vision and mission of Rewired, trying to create a justice-oriented tech space.</p>
        <p>I was also part of the tech team, and helped build the front-end in React and Sass, while the back-end was built with a headless WordPress CMS and Gatsby.</p>

        <h3>Brick Kiln Prediction</h3>
        <p>In the summer after my sophomore year, I was a research intern working on improving a brick kiln prediction AI model. Our input was satellite imagery from Bangladesh, which we would put through a CNN to detect brick kilns in the images. This is relevant because the brick kilns can contribute to substantial air pollution and GHG emissions, and can also be sites of exploitation of workers.</p>
        <p>My fellow intern and I ran experiments with the model to improve its accuracy to a point where it could be reliably used. My experiments were focused on efficiency, using zoomed out images, as well as the expanded capability to detect shape. I also created a web interface for error analysis using Flask.</p>

        <h3>Envisioning Environmentally and Racially Just Futures</h3>
        <p>For my final project for <i>PWR194EP: Intro to Environmental Justice</i>, I created a <a href="https://christ17.github.io/ej-project/index.html" target="_blank">website</a> to serve as a digital storytelling platform to provide context on the relationship between tech and environmental justice.</p>
        <p>I analyzed environmental injustices at multiple scopes, as well as pointed to examples of using tech towards a more just orientation. I incorporated multiple forms of media and used the interconnectedness of a website to really make use of the digital platform.</p>

        <p>I worked on the <a href="https://landtalk.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Land Talk</a> project as an intern for the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford. Land Talk is an environmental storytelling and education project that aims to capture how landscapes change over time through interviews.</p>
        <p>I migrated the site to Stanford AFS servers from a third-party server, refined the user interface in React, and created the templates for Resources and Lesson Plans using WordPress. I also did research on developing lesson plans, particularly in designing them to align with Common Core standards.</p>

        <p>I was part of the organizing team for <a href="https://treehacks.com/" target="_blank">TreeHacks</a> 2019 (design not pictured) and 2020. I was part of the tech team for TreeHacks 2019 that built an open-source infrastructure for the website, and also led a push to make TreeHacks more sustainable in 2020.</p>
